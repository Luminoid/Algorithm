# Knapsack Problem
Given a set of items, each with a weight and a value, determine the number of each item to include in a collection 
so that the total weight is less than or equal to a given limit and the total value is as large as possible.

## 0-1 Knapsack Problem
### Description
The number of copies of each kind of item is restricted to zero or one.

### Solution
Dynamic programming

### Time Complexity
pseudo-polynomial time

## Fractional Knapsack Problem
### Description
Also known as continuous knapsack problem.
Fill a knapsack with fractional amounts of different materials chosen to maximize the value of the selected materials.

### Solution
Greedy Algorithm

### Time Complexity
polynomial time
