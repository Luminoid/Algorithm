# N-Queens
## Description
(From [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/n-queens/))

The n-queens puzzle is the problem of placing n queens on an n√ón chessboard such that no two queens attack each other.

Given an integer n, return all distinct solutions to the n-queens puzzle.
Each solution contains a distinct board configuration of the n-queens' placement, where `Q` and `.` both indicate a queen
 and an empty space respectively.
For example, there exist two distinct solutions to the 4-queens puzzle:
```
[
 [".Q..",  // Solution 1
  "...Q",
  "Q...",
  "..Q."],

 ["..Q.",  // Solution 2
  "Q...",
  "...Q",
  ".Q.."]
]
```

## Algorithm
1. Backtracking by two-dimensional boolean array representing the whole chessboard
2. Backtracking by one-dimensional int array representing the queen position in every line
